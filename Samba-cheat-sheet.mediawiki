== How to create a read-only shared folder for Windows ==

Add a section like this at the end of <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>:

<pre># A publicly accessible directory for all kinds of exports
[export]
        comment = All kinds of exports
        path = /export
        read only = yes
        guest ok = yes
        guest only = yes
</pre>

By default other Linux machines will be able to access this share, 
but to make it accessible from Windows you must tweak the <code>security</code> option in <code>smb.conf</code>:
 security = share

Make sure Samba service is running and listening on port 139.
 netstat -ntl | grep 139/

Check on a Windows machine that the Samba share is visible
 net view \\servername
 dir \\servername\export

To start Samba automatically at system boot (redhat):
 chkconfig smb on
